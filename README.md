# Forest-Type-Cover-Classification
In this project there will be created a model using deep learning to predict forest cover type (the most common kind of tree cover) based only on cartographic variables. The actual forest cover type for a given 30 x 30 meter cell was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data.
